# Laravel 5 - Practice and implementation
This is an example of implementation of Laravel 5. Im giving a lot of personal touch as per my need:

1. Using a lot of my own Helpers
2. Personal encryption and login system, instead of `Authentication` of laravel
3. See Controller.php, Route.php, adminBasicAuth.php (middleware) etc to get the idea how things are going.
4. See the login.php controller
5. see layout and login views
